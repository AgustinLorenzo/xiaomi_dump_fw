Description:  The HTTP Time Protocol (HTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
 with web servers as reference time source. Htpdate will synchronize your
 computer's time by extracting timestamps from HTTP headers found
 in web server responses. Htpdate can be used as a daemon, to keep your
 computer synchronized.
